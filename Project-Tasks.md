# Project Tasks for the Candidate
We are excited to have you on board. This project is about enhancing our existing Tunnels Length Detection software. Specifically, we need your expertise in data preprocessing, augmentation techniques, and integrating new OCR functionality. Below are the major tasks that need to be completed:

## Task 1: Fix Bugs in the Dataloader
The first task involves debugging and fixing issues in our current dataloader. The dataloader plays a crucial role in our system, handling the loading and pre-processing of our image datasets. We've been experiencing a few bugs recently that are affecting the system's performance and reliability. Your task will be to:

- Identify the cause(s) of these bugs.
- Develop appropriate fixes and perform testing to ensure the issues are fully resolved.
- Document the changes made and any additional steps required to avoid these issues in the future.

## Task 2: Add Random Crop Augmentation
The second task is to add random crop augmentation to our image preprocessing pipeline. Data augmentation is a powerful technique to improve the performance of our model by providing more varied data for training. For our specific use case, random cropping can help the model to learn to recognize text in different positions and scales. Your tasks will be to:

- Implement a random crop function that can be applied during the preprocessing stage.
- Ensure the function properly handles different image sizes and aspect ratios.
- Integrate this function into the existing pipeline and verify its functionality through testing.

## Task 3: Integrate easyOCR into the OCR Readers
Lastly, we are planning to extend our OCR functionality by integrating the easyOCR reader. easyOCR is a powerful tool capable of reading many different languages, and its addition will significantly enhance the versatility and accuracy of our OCR system. Your tasks in this regard will be:

Understand the workings of easyOCR and how it can be integrated with our current system.
Implement the integration, ensuring that the existing system functionality remains unaffected.
Conduct thorough testing to ensure the newly integrated OCR reader functions as expected.
Please remember to comment your code and document your work. This will make it easier for other team members to understand your changes and for you to track your progress.

We look forward to your contributions to this project. Should you encounter any difficulties or require further clarification, please feel free to reach out.
